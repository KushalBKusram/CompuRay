## CompuRay with HoloLens

CompuRay augments the experience involved during troubleshooting or upgrading of a traditional desktop computer. This project makes use of Microsoft HoloLens, the AR device recognizes various components of the computer and the results are spatial mapped to the real-world through HoloLens. The HoloLens was trained to recognize the following components of a computer cabinet: CPU, Drive Bay, SMPS, GPU, RAM and PCI Slots. 

Requirements: 
HoloLens (1st Gen), Visual Studio 2017, Unity 2018.4, HoloToolKit. 

The interface provided for a user to interact with HoloLens is through voice commands, except during the phase of analysis. The advantage of voice commands over traditional HoloLens recognizable gestures includes handsfree control along with a more natural UI and almost a zero-learning curve in order to operate the device.
You can refer to our official blog [CompuRay with HoloLens](https://compuray.home.blog) for a detailed documentation. This repo mainly provides you with code, which might be helpful for you to build something upon.
